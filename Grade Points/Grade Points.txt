Grade Points
At Raffleâ€™s Academy, students are given grade points to a maximum of 5 during their final exam. The grade points are mapped to Letter grades as follows.

Letter Grade             Grade points

O                                        5

A                                       >= 4.5 and <5.0

B                                        >= 4.0 and <4.5

C                                         >=3.0 and <4.0

D                                         >=2.0 and <3.0

E                                         >=1.0 and <2.0

F                                          >=0.0 and <1.0
